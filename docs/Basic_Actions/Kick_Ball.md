# Kick Ball
##### [Go back to main page](../../Documentation.md)

This functionality is implemented in the physical model of the ball. If the ball recieves a kick from a robot
as a command, it will check if the robot is inside a circle of radius 0.2 units.

## The direction of kick
The direction of kick is away from the centre of the round robot. In other words, the direction of the kick is
collinear with the center of the robot and center of the ball.
